# MISSION SUMMARY

Earth’s first mission to Mars hangs in jeopardy. Only the brightest minds, and the sharpest tools can recover the crew and get humanity’s progress back on track. 

To help re-establish communications with the team on Mars, you must accomplish the goals outlined below. Each task will start with a tutorial to help you get up to speed with the technology quickly, and then end with mission-specific goals.  

You will be working in teams, and while there is glory for those who finish the tasks first, the mission isn't complete until all teams succeed. Please be willing to help if you see another team in difficulty.

Mission control has established the following three goals.

[Establish A Connection](IoTHubs)

[Repeating Signal](AzureFunctions)

[Verify Crew](CognitiveServices)
